<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm a graduate in Computer Science and Software Engineering at <i>Universitat de Barcelona</i> and a recent master in Artifical Intelligence from a joint collaboration between <i>Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya,
Universitat de Barcelona and Universitat Rovira i Virgili</i>. I'm currently looking into expanding my career in the field of AI.</p>
<p>Even though I'm no longer actively studying I'm still keeping track of the most relevant machine learning papers and technologies, searching for cool ways to use them or build projects around them. This is also useful as I'm involved in monitoring a computer vision competiton which was a follow-up work from my master's thesis.</p>
<p>As a hobby I usually play videogames and I also enjoy traditional board games. I'm currently engrossed into Mahjong and trying to learn Go due to all the hype around AlphaGo.</p>
